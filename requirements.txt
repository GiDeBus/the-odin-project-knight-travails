Instructions for the project:

1. Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.

2. Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.

3. Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.

4. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square.
