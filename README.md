# the-odin-project-knight-travails

The task for this project is to create a function that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting 
all squares the knight piece will stop on along the way.

Example:

```
knight_moves([3, 3], [4, 3])
==> You made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:
[3, 3]
[4, 5]
[2, 4]
[4, 3]
```

To run the file navigate to the project's main directory and run the `bin` file:
```
ruby ./lib/main
```
