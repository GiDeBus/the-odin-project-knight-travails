# the-odin-project-knight-travails

The task for this project is to create a function that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting 
all squares the knight piece will stop on along the way.

Example:

```
knight_moves([3, 3], [4, 3])
==> You made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:
[3, 3]
[4, 5]
[2, 4]
[4, 3]
```

To run the file navigate to the project's main directory and run the `bin` file:
```
ruby ./lib/knight_travails
```

### Project instructions:

1. Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.

2. Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.

3. Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.

4. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square.
